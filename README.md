# Convex Hull
## Phase 1:   
Check whether two lines intersect to better understand convex hull algorithm  
## Phase 2:  
Convex Hull algorithms implementated: **Jarvis Walk Algorithm** and **Graham Scan Algorithm**  
## Phase 3:  
Compute the upper tangents and lower tangents when given polygons  
## Phase 4:  
Convex Hull divde-and-conquer algorithm
