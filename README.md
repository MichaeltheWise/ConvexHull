# Convex Hull
## Phase 1:   
Check whether two lines intersect to better understand convex hull algorithm  
## Phase 2:  
Convex Hull algorithms implementated: **Jarvis Walk Algorithm** and **Graham Scan Algorithm**  
My implementation of convex Hull Graham Scan has issues when points are in negative quadrants  
(Most likely in sorting portion of the algorithm)  
## Phase 3:  
Compute the upper tangents and lower tangents when given polygons  
## Phase 4:  
Convex Hull divde-and-conquer algorithm using the upper and lower tangents  
## Phase 5:  
Try out some parallel processing concepts using **multiprocessing** in ParallelConvexHull
